# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

## Overview
The [**Home Credit Default Risk Analysis**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) project aims to enhance financial inclusion by predicting loan repayment capabilities for individuals with limited or no credit history. Using alternative data, we developed a supervised machine learning model to evaluate creditworthiness and provide actionable insights for lenders.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions often rely on traditional credit scores, which can exclude individuals lacking credit history. This project focuses on creating a predictive model that utilizes alternative data sources, enabling informed lending decisions and expanding opportunities for both borrowers and lenders.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model to evaluate loan default risk.
- Increase loan approval rates while maintaining or reducing lender risk.
- Provide business insights to drive data-informed decision-making.

## Data and Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Provided datasets include demographic, transactional, and telco data from orignial [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview) competition 
- **EDA:** Explored trends, identified missing values, and performed data preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables to enhance predictive performance.
- **Modeling:** Built and fine-tuned a logistic regression classifier to predict loan defaults.
- **Visualization:** Generated insightful plots to communicate findings effectively.
